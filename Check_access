3. Solution Approach
To solve the challenge of identifying Chemical and Packaging components in BOM data, we implemented a hybrid categorization pipeline using a combination of rule-based logic and AI/ML techniques. The solution is designed to be scalable, auditable, and easy to integrate with existing data quality workflows.

üîç Key Elements of the Approach:
‚úÖ 1. Hybrid Classification Strategy
Rule-Based Mapping: Wherever possible, predefined mappings based on existing domain knowledge are applied directly.

ML-Based Inference: For unmapped or ambiguous cases, machine learning models predict the category using text descriptions and other engineered features.

‚úÖ 2. AI/ML Pipeline Design
Uses BioBERT-based embeddings to understand unstructured text in the component description.

Merges embeddings with structured fields like unit of measure and material type.

Employs LightGBM models to predict both category and subcategory with high confidence.

‚úÖ 3. Traceability and Confidence
Every prediction is accompanied by:

Confidence Score

Matching Reason

These allow for easy auditing and review of AI decisions.

‚úÖ 4. Modular and Scalable Architecture
The pipeline is divided into independent stages:

Extraction & mapping

Preprocessing & feature engineering

Model inference

Merging results back to source

It supports parallel execution and can run in local or Azure cloud environments.
