Subject: Summary of Analysis on Off Spec Matches

Hi Niharika,

Below is the summary of the analysis:

We identified certain components that fall under the Off Spec Match category. To address this, we have implemented new logic to classify them as Off Spec Non Matches.

HBOM Check for Off Spec

Description	Count of CMPNT_MATL_NUM
NLP did not match because component is missing in NLP Input BOM_HIER_DTLS	9
NLP did not match because material is missing in NLP Input BOM_HIER_DTLS	6
Off Spec Match	10
Off Spec Non Match	108
Grand Total	133

We are using Material Number and Component ID as the matching criteria.

HBOM Check for PC & DC Spec

Description	Count of CMPNT_MATL_NUM
NLP did not match because component is missing in NLP Input BOM_HIER_DTLS	161
NLP matched	521
Not matched in any round	22
Off Spec Match	8
Off Spec Non Match	10
Grand Total	722

Let’s discuss this further in tomorrow’s call.

Best regards,
Arvind
