Hi Team,

Thank you for sharing the sample data. Below is the summary of the model's prediction performance:

Class	Support (Actual)	Correct Predictions	Precision	Recall	F1 Score
API	167	159	1.00	0.95	0.97
FNW	2902	2838	0.999	0.98	0.99
Liquids and Creams	192	143	1.00	0.74	0.85
Overall Accuracy	3261	3140			96%

Note: As Niharika mentioned in her earlier email, the class FNW_CHM is not a distinct category. However, the current model was trained under the assumption that it is. I will need to run another iteration with the corrected label structure to finalize the model.

Best regards,
Arvind
