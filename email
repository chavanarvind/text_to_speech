Hi Gabriel,

Upon discussion, we decided to add a new column named “ERP material number” in TRU_PRODUCT_SUMMARY table and this column should fetch data from the following.

-	Ims : NEW_MATCH_MATL_NUM
-	Ems : MATL_NUM
-	Tru FGs that are not available in neither of the ERPs : ERP_PART_NUM

There is no need to modify the existing MATL_NUM column in TRU_PRODUCT_SUMMARY table.

Can you please consider this request? Please let me know if you need any further information.
