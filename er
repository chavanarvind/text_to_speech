create new column 'mapping_column' . Add values in CMPNT_CAT_CD_DESC as it is. If CMPNT_CAT_CD_DESC is blank and CMPNT_MATL_TYPE_CD have value then replace that cell  with CMPNT_MATL_TYPE_CD and if CMPNT_CAT_CD_DESC and CMPNT_MATL_TYPE_CD is blank then replace with CMPNT_MATL_DESC values and if all three cols are blank then value will be 'No data for prediction'
