1. Unit Standardization
Mapped unit codes (e.g., KG, ML, EA) to logical groups such as:

CHM for chemical weights (KG, G, MG, etc.)

Liquid for volumes (L, ML, CC, etc.)

Discrete for piece counts (EA, PCS, PCK, etc.)

Containers (BOTTLE, ROLL, etc.)

Dimensional (FT, M, YD, etc.)

Unclassified for ambiguous/rare units

2. Abbreviation Expansion
Loaded a curated mapping file to replace common abbreviations with full forms
(e.g., inj. → injection, soln. → solution)

3. Text Normalization & Cleaning
Applied regex-based patterns to:

Remove non-alphanumeric characters

Normalize and remove variant forms of "Canada"

Standardize spacing around units and %

Merge unit and numeric patterns (e.g., 5 ml, 10g)

Fix SPF formatting issues (e.g., spf30 → SPF 30)

4. Column-Wise Application
Cleaning applied to all relevant text columns (e.g., Material Description, Component Description)

Ensured casing consistency and whitespace trimming

Final cleaned text used for further modeling and analysis
