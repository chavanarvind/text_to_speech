ValueError: class_weight 'balanced' is not supported for partial_fit. In order to use 'balanced' weights, use compute_class_weight('balanced', classes=classes, y=y). In place of y you can use a large enough sample of the full training set target to properly estimate the class frequency distributions. Pass the resulting weights as the class_weight parameter.
