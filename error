Next Step: Business Validation of Model Predictions

What We Need from Business
Please provide a sample dataset that includes:

✅ Component/Product Descriptions (same as used in BOM or ERP)

✅ Human-assigned Final Categories (ground truth)

⚠️ Ideally include edge cases or previously misclassified examples

Recommended Volume:

~2,000 to 5,000 samples

Mixed distribution across all known categories

Estimated Timeline (for 20% data)
Task	Estimated Time
Data preprocessing & loading	1–2 hours
BioBERT embedding generation	6–8 hours (GPU)
Model inference & saving results	1–2 hours
Evaluation & summary report	1 hour

🕒 Total: ~9–13 hours, preferably overnight on GPU infrastructure.
