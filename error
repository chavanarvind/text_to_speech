Hi Team,
This is regarding the RPM Categorization project. Currently, we are pushing the data into a container. However, Jay and his team are expecting the data to be mounted so they can directly reference it as a table.

We would appreciate your support in helping us complete this task.
Jay, please feel free to add anything I may have missed.
