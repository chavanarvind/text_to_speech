1. Data Sampling
Read all cleaned .parquet files containing labeled component data.

Apply stratified sampling per category from each file (5% or min 1000 rows).

Concatenate sampled data into a training dataset.

2. Preprocessing & Feature Engineering
Text Features: TF-IDF vectorization on CMPNT_MATL_DESC using unigrams and bigrams.

Numeric Feature: Description length (CMPNT_MATL_DESC_LEN), standardized.

Categorical Features: Encoded UNIT_GROUP and CMPNT_MATL_TYPE_CATEGORY using OrdinalEncoder.

3. Model Training
Used SGDClassifier with log_loss (logistic regression with SGD).

Applied online learning (batch-wise training via partial_fit) over all files.

Used class weights to handle imbalance.

Monitored validation loss with early stopping (patience = 2).

4. Evaluation
Final performance assessed on hold-out test set:

Top-1 & Top-3 Accuracy

Log Loss, F1 Score (Macro, Micro, Weighted)
