Hi Niharika,

As discussed, Iâ€™m sharing the list of pairs with high confidence as well as the pairs that have been categorized as off-spec due to the child number description aligning with the off-spec criteria.

Please note: the pairs falling under the off-spec category will not appear in the final results since the off-spec mapping logic is handled separately from the high-confidence mapping. To include these records in the final results, we would need to revisit and potentially update the off-spec logic, which will require further discussion.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
