ontext	Frequency	Rationale
Stable formulations (e.g., legacy drugs)	Quarterly	Low change, fewer new components
High R&D activity (e.g., clinical pipeline, new SKUs)	Monthly	Frequent additions of new materials/descriptions
Regulatory Label or Compliance Updates	As needed	Triggered by external events (e.g., FDA changes)
Drift Detection (if misclassification rises > 2â€“3%)	On demand	Use accuracy monitoring to trigger retraining
