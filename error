Hi Team,

Here are the latest updates:
•	We now have access to the required data in Databricks. Today, Niharika shared a sample of the target column.
•	We plan to start building the skeleton for multiple predictive models from 11th April for sample data.
•	We're still awaiting access to the Azure Datastore, which is required to build the pipeline and process the data – closing it before 14th Apr

Thanks,
Arvind
