Hi Katie,

Hope you're doing well.

As part of the RPM categorization pipeline, I’ve prepared the processed output files and model artifacts. Could you please share the Azure Storage account details where I should push these files?

Specifically, I’m looking for:

The storage account name

The appropriate container name and folder path

Any access credentials or connection string I should use

Also, let me know if there are any specific conventions I should follow for organizing these files.

Thanks for your help!

Best regards,
Arvind
