Please note: in my test results, these pairs are not appearing because, although they were initially considered high-confidence records, the child number falls under the off-spec category based on its description. As a result, our current logic skips these records from the final output. To include them, we would need to revisit and potentially update the off-spec mapping logic, which will require further discussion.
