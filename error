Hi [Recipient's Name],

Hope you're doing well.

I wanted to confirm the structure for the weekly output as follows:

A new folder named in the format hbom_category_prediction_DDMMYYYY/ will be generated every week under the main hbom_category_prediction directory.

Each of these weekly folders will contain 1000+ Parquet files, representing the output for that week.

There will be no single consolidated output file â€” the output will be distributed across multiple Parquet files within each folder.

Let me know if you'd like us to explore an option for consolidated output or have any other questions.

Best regards,
Arvind
