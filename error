Problem Statement
Description of materials and components needed to make our products exist in several systems across Kenvue with no harmonised single source of truth. The BOM X-ref project aims to bridge two main groups of systems, ERP and Tru, into a common validated reference. 

The end product is a table of cross references, linking matching components and categorising additional items for review. This will be a foundational structure for several use cases, among them Data Quality and Material Harmonisation.







High Level Technical Solution
Match descriptions in rounds using several pieces of information:

Simple join of common cleaned IDâ€™s
Raw materials IDâ€™s included in the descriptions
Simple text similarity: Jaccard, Levenstein, etc.
Cosine similarity of Sentence Embeddings
Resources
Approx: 100 MB Weekly Data (Parquet Files)

Embeddings: ca. 250k individual descriptions to process -> each of around 30 tokens -> 7.5m tokens per run < 1 USD per run (USD 0.0001 per 1K tokens).
