Subject: Weekly Pipeline Results Availability (Production Environment)

Hi Team,

Please note that the pipeline is now running in the production environment and is scheduled to execute every Wednesday at 12:00 AM IST. As a result, the output will be available every Thursday.

For processing purposes, I have already pushed the results for 28th June. All expected columns are present in the output.

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
