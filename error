For which date the folders will get created next week?
 
Because ingestion team has scheduled their job to run on every Thursday at 6 am. So their job will search for folder name with 31072025, 07082025, 14082025, etc.

Ist time?
 
Ingestion team's job will run on every thursday at 4 AM EST.
 
So, we want folders to be created before 4 AM EST and should have thursday date in the folder name.
